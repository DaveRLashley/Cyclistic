### The Business Challenge

The Director of Marketing at Cyclistic believes the company‚Äôs future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. My task was to analyze historical ride data to identify trends and behavioral differences between casual riders and members to inform a new data-driven marketing strategy.

### Key Insight & Featured Visualization

My analysis revealed that while members take significantly more trips, **casual riders use the service for much longer durations on average, especially on weekends.** This suggests casual riders use the bikes for leisure and exploration, presenting a key opportunity for targeted membership campaigns focused on weekend passes or leisure-based perks.
